/**
 * JSON body parser for individual APME catalog routes that read `req.body`.
 *
 * This module mounts on the **catalog** plugin HTTP stack (`httpRouter.use`).
 * Middleware registered with `router.use(...)` therefore runs for every catalog
 * request — including core routes such as `POST /entities/by-refs`.
 *
 * **Do not** call `router.use(jsonBody)` (or `router.use(json())`). A global
 * parser consumes the request stream before the core catalog handler can read
 * it, which surfaces as HTTP 500 `stream is not readable` on Relations and
 * other by-refs consumers. Attach `jsonBody` only as route-level middleware on
 * POST/PUT handlers under `/apme/...` that need a body.
 *
 * Same rule as `catalog-backend-module-rhaap` (`router.ts`).
 *
 * @see router.test.ts — "does not consume request bodies for non-APME catalog POSTs"
